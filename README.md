## Youtube Manger

An App to help us manage Youtube videos with categories and timestamps

### How to use
* Create a video info with Youtube url then add timestamps
* Timestamps can be a targeting time or a range of time
* Timestamps can also be categorized
* After created a new video info, users can view the result from sidebar
* Share your video info is also availiable

### Future Plan
* Create a Database to store data for individual (Currently, I am using localStorage to store data)
* Better UI
* Group by video by using some filters (Maybe can watch several videos and use timestamps and the same screen)
* Support other languages

Although Youtube has released their own cliping tools, I will keep working on this project.
